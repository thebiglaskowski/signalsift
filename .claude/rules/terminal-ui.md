2. Visual clarity — Important info stands out
3. Graceful degradation — Works everywhere
4. Helpful errors — What went wrong AND how to fix

## Status Indicators

✓ Success (green)
✗ Error (red)
⚠ Warning (yellow)
ℹ Info (blue)

```

```

## Error Structure
1. What went wrong
2. Where it happened
3. Why it might have happened
